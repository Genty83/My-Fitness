### CSS
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) found no errors on my CSS files.

### Python

Pylint was used continuously during the development process to analyze the Python code for programming errors.

The code was then checked for errors via the terminal command "python3 -m flake8". This returned a number of whitespace and indentation errors which were rectified where possible. (The unfixed errors were situated in root files such as .vscode/artictern)

Other errors regarding unused imports were corrected by removing the unnecessary files.

### Javascript

* [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) found a total of 6 warnings concerning missing or unnecessary semicolons. These warnings were corrected.


## Accessibility

Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools has been used to confirm that the colors and fonts being used throughout the website are easy to read and accessible. See reports in the table below:
